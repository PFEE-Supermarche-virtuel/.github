# Welcome to the Virtual Supermarket! 🛒🥦🌟

Hi there 👋

We are a little team and this GitHub is dedicated to our main project, the Virtual Supermarket.

## Description ℹ️

The Virtual Supermarket is a web application that replicates an online supermarket experience. It provides users with an interactive immersion into a virtual environment, assisting them in making healthier food choices.
This innovative tool aims to improve the eating habits of users, especially those who suffer from obesity or have cardiovascular problems.

The application comprises two key components:

- The server, built with NestJS.
- The supermarket, a React application.

The server is seamlessly connected to a MongoDB database.

## Features 🎉

- Virtual supermarket experience.
- Role-playing game-style educational modules.
- Intuitive user interface emulating a physical supermarket.
- Separate profiles tailored for patients and doctors.
- Integration of artificial intelligence for user behavior analysis.

Our mission is to leverage technology to promote healthier dietary choices and provide an engaging platform to help users achieve their health goals.
